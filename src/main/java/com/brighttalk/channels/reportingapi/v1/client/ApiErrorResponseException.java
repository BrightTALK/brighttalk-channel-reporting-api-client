/**
 * Class of non-checked (runtime) exception thrown to report an error response for a failed API request.
 * <p>
 * Subclass' {@link HttpErrorResponseException}, reflecting the fact that the API uses HTTP and a RESTful style of error
 * reporting based on using a combination of standard HTTP status codes and an API specific {@link ApiError} body.
 * <p>
 * The HTTP status code can be used to classify the error as either a client (4xx series) or server (5xx series)
 * originating error. The presence of an {@link Error} in the response body distinguishes an error response returned by
 * the API service from an intermediate web server/proxy.
 * <p>
 * Inspired by org.springframework.web.client.HttpClientErrorException
