/**
 * Custom class of JAXB {@link XmlAdapter} for converting an XML string value to/from an Integer which doesn't cause a
 * fatal error on umarshalling a non-integer string.
 * 
 * <h2>Motivation</h2>
 * The default behaviour of most XmlAdapter in the JAXB reference implementation (RI) is to report a
 * non-fatal validation error if a type mismatch / conversion error occurs on unmarshalling, leaving the target field
 * set to its default value and continuing with unmarshalling the rest of the XML document. However, there is a bug in
 * the RI which results in it throwing a fatal NumberFormatException if it unmarshalls a non-integer string. This custom
 * XmlAdapter has been created to work around this bug and ensure consistent error handling with the XmlAdapter for
 * other types.
