    <title>Multichannel Marketing in an Era of Hyper-Accommodation</title>
    <description>Customers have become increasingly empowered and discerning through technology. They no longer let brand owners, retailers, or mass media dictate their agenda. So accommodating customers today is more challenging for marketers than ever before.

This webinar focuses on the strategic dimensions and success factors for engaging customers across discreet yet interconnected marketing channels. The emphasis includes: (1) perspectives on effective multichannel strategy, (2) frameworks for building omni-channel architecture, and (3) tools for equipping organizations to deliver brand designed experiences across channels . . . seamlessly. 

The takeaway will be a better understanding of how to develop &amp; deploy multichannel strategies in a fiscally responsible way that fits your business model, brand positioning, and organizational culture.</description>
